DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a simple interface to MythTV by making HTTP
    requests to its MythWeb web server front end. MythTV is a free open
    source digital video recorder. Find out more at
    <http://www.mythtv.org/>.

    This module allows you to query the recordings, download them to a local
    file and schedule new recordings.

METHODS
  new
    The constructor takes a hostname and port:

      my $mythweb = Net::MythWeb->new( hostname => 'owl.local', port => 80 );

  channels
    List the channels and return them as Net::MythWeb::Channel objects:

      foreach my $channel ( $mythweb->channels ) {
          print $channel->name . "\n";
      }

  recordings
    List the recordings and return them as Net::MythWeb::Programme objects:

      foreach my $recording ( $mythweb->recordings ) {
        print $recording->channel->id, ', ', $recording->channel->number, ', ',
            $recording->channel->name, "\n";
        print $recording->start, ' -> ', $recording->stop, ': ', $recording->title,
            ', ',
            $recording->subtitle, ', ',
            $recording->description;
            $recording->download("recording.mpg");
            $recording->delete;
       }

  programme
    Returns a Net::MythWeb::Programme for the programme which starts at a
    given time on the channel:
